# DRDO_Assignment
This repository is for the assignment of the DRDO internship.
It includes the deep learning models to tackle the below scenarios.


This repository consists of two scenarios

1. Scenario - 01:

   A flower bouquet shop wants to enhance its customer experience by implementing an
  image classification component. The goal is to create a mobile app that allows customers to
  take pictures of flowers they encounter and receive information about the flower species,
  care instructions, and the option to order similar flowers. Develop a ML model for aforesaid
  classification with an example Dataset.

2. Scenario - 02:

   A military organization wants to develop a machine learning model that can identify enemy
   vehicles in satellite imagery. The model will take as input a satellite image and output a list
   of bounding boxes that correspond to the location of enemy vehicles in the image. Develop
   a ML solution for the aforesaid scenario with an example Dataset.
